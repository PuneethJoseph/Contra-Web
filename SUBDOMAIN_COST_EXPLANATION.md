# Subdomain Cost: Are Subdomains Free?

## ✅ YES - Subdomains are 100% FREE!

**Short Answer:** When you own a domain (like `puneethjoseph.in`), you automatically own ALL subdomains for FREE. No additional payment required!

## How It Works

### What You Own

When you purchase `puneethjoseph.in` from Zoho (or any registrar), you automatically get:

- ✅ `puneethjoseph.in` - Your main domain
- ✅ `www.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE subdomain
- ✅ `contra.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE subdomain
- ✅ `blog.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE subdomain
- ✅ `shop.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE subdomain
- ✅ `anything.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE subdomain
- ✅ **Unlimited subdomains** - All FREE!

### No Additional Cost

- ❌ You do NOT pay per subdomain
- ❌ You do NOT need to "purchase" subdomains
- ❌ You do NOT need to upgrade your plan
- ✅ Subdomains are included with your domain purchase
- ✅ Just configure DNS records (also free)

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Configure DNS (FREE)

1. Log in to Zoho → Domains → `puneethjoseph.in`
2. Go to DNS Management
3. Add a CNAME record (takes 2 minutes, costs nothing)
4. That's it!

### Step 2: Point to Your Service

- Point `contra.puneethjoseph.in` to GitHub Pages (free)
- Point `blog.puneethjoseph.in` to a blog (if you want)
- Point `shop.puneethjoseph.in` to a shop (if you want)
- All free!

## Comparison: Domain vs Subdomain

### Domain (What You Bought)
- `puneethjoseph.in` - You paid for this
- Includes all subdomains automatically

### Subdomain (What You're Creating)
- `contra.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE
- Just a DNS configuration

## Zoho Domain Features

When you buy a domain from Zoho, you get:

- ✅ Domain registration
- ✅ DNS management (free)
- ✅ Unlimited subdomains (free)
- ✅ Email forwarding (if included in your plan)

**Subdomains are a standard feature** - not an add-on purchase.

## Alternative: If You Don't Want to Use Subdomain

If for some reason you don't want to use a subdomain, you have these FREE options:

### Option 1: Use GitHub Pages URL Directly
- URL: `https://puneethjoseph.github.io/Contra-Web/`
- Cost: FREE
- No DNS configuration needed
- Works immediately

### Option 2: Use a Different Subdomain
- `www.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE
- `con.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE
- `track.puneethjoseph.in` - FREE
- All free, just configure DNS

### Option 3: Use Root Domain (Not Recommended)
- `puneethjoseph.in` - Would replace your main site
- Still FREE, but not recommended

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to pay Zoho for subdomains?
**A:** No! Subdomains are included FREE with your domain.

### Q: Is there a limit on subdomains?
**A:** Usually no limit, but check your Zoho plan. Most plans allow unlimited subdomains.

### Q: Do I need to "register" or "purchase" a subdomain?
**A:** No! Just add a DNS record. The subdomain automatically exists.

### Q: Will this affect my main site?
**A:** No! `puneethjoseph.in` stays on Zoho Sites. `contra.puneethjoseph.in` points to GitHub Pages. They're independent.

### Q: Can I remove the subdomain later?
**A:** Yes! Just delete the DNS record. No cost to remove.
